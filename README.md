# Introduction to Excel VBA
This challenge includes VBA scripts and screenshots of the scripts in use. The data is various stocks, their opening and closing prices, and total volume for the year. 

## Summary of Code
With this script, I started with defining the dimensions and the variables. From there, I wrote a 'For Loop' to print out the different ticker symbols for the stock. Within the loop, I also calculated the change of the stock price from the first day of the year to the last. This calculation helped calculate the percentage change. The code is written to go through each worksheet in the workbook and run the same code.
